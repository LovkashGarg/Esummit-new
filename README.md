After signing in as an admin, you will see the "Dashboard" option in the navigation bar. You will also see a "Welcome Admin" message confirming your role.

### 3. Role Management & User Actions
Clicking on the "Dashboard" will take you to the admin dashboard, where you can manage users, verify transactions, and manage user roles.

Only users with admin access can reach these routes, and non-admins cannot access the backend APIs associated with admin functionalities, as middleware has been integrated to enforce this security. For this you can hit on the [https://esummit24.iiitp.ac.in/admin](https://esummit24.iiitp.ac.in/admin) when you sign in as user or without sign in.
